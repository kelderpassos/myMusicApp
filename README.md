## Lessons Learned

The main goal of this project is to start put into practice 
what I've learned of Javascript and React on the course of 4 months of studying these technologies
being my first personal project. I was able to practice and learn:
- API requests;
- Develop my CSS skills with Styled Components;
- Start for the first time a React project using Vite;
- Work with Functional Components and Hooks
- Stabilish routes with React Router Dom v6


## Challenges
- Config and develop tests with Vitest (the toughest challenge, still under development);
- Develop CSS aiming for responsiveness on small devices;
- Use the same component on different pages;

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, React Router Dom v6, Styled Components, Vitest and React Testing Library
